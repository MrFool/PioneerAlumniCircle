===================

Pioneer Alumni Circle (PAC) Mission: To establish an extensive network of meaningful and fulfilling relationships among the students and alumni of Pioneer Junior College as well as to foster a vibrant Pioneer fraternity.

PAC has been connecting and distributing information with it's alumni via a Facebook group and through friends.

We think there is an even better way - that is, to adopt a multi-pronged approach in distributing information and connecting with our alumni.

Here are some of the things that we are aiming for in this iteration of the PAC website:

+  Sending emails
+  Interactive timeline
+  Mobile-Friendly look

This project is still in its early stages, expect changes and updates.

Why make this project open-source:

What better way to connect with Pioneer Junior College Alumnus who wants to contribute to PAC in a meaningful way?
